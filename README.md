# Remote_Voting_Machine
Remote Voting Machine is a project deveoped by me and my friend to develop a voting system which allows one to vote from the comforts of their home via their mobile phone or personal computer while also implementing a face recognition system to ensure security.

We have developed a website which allows one to vote - the backend of the website is written in PHP with the face recognition implemented using Python.

The repository was kept private for a long time (with no README), but since now I have decided to open it in public domain, I shall update the README from time to time and also improve upon the code and files structure.
